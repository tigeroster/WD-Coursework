        <p id="heading"> The impact of technology on sports: Is it a positive or negative influence? </p>
        <p> <span id="firstLetter">T</span>echnology has revolutionized the way we play, watch and experience sports. From better equipment to 
            video review, the benefits of technology in sports are many. However, it's important to weigh these advantages against the potential 
            downsides of technology in sports.
        </p>
    
        <p class="topics"> Equipment </p>
        <p> One of the most obvious benefits of technology in sports is the improvement of equipment. Advanced materials and manufacturing 
            processes have allowed for

        </figure>
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="subtopics"> Better performance </span> - Equipment like running shoes, tennis rackets, and golf clubs have all 
                undergone significant technological advances, leading to better performance and increased durability.
            </li>
            <li> <span class="subtopics"> Injury prevention </span> - Protective gear, like helmets and pads, have evolved to better protect 
                athletes from injury. For example, new materials in football helmets can help reduce the risk of concussions.
            </li>
            <li> <span class="subtopics"> Enhanced measurement </span> - Wearable technology, like fitness trackers and heart rate monitors, allow 
                athletes to track their progress and tailor their training to optimize performance.
            </li>
        </ul>        
    
        <p class="topics"> Gameplay </p>
        <p> Technology has also had a significant impact on gameplay, both positive and negative. </p>
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="subtopics"> Video review </span> - The use of instant replay has become a common feature in many sports, allowing 
                referees to review key moments and make more accurate decisions. This has helped reduce the number of missed calls and improved 
                the overall fairness of the game.
            </li>
            <li> <span class="subtopics"> Electronic scoreboards </span> - Gone are the days of manually updating scores with a chalkboard or paper. 
                Electronic scoreboards have become a staple in many sports, providing real-time updates to fans and players alike.
            </li>
            <li> <span class="subtopics"> Over-reliance </span> - On the negative side, some argue that technology has made the game too reliant on 
                machines and less reliant on human judgement. For example, the use of goal-line technology in soccer has taken away some of the 
                human element of the game, potentially leading to less dramatic moments and less of a connection between players and fans.
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <p class="topics"> Fan Experience </p>
        <p> Finally, technology has also had a significant impact on the way fans experience sports. </p>

            <figcaption> Watching sports from TV </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="subtopics"> Remote viewing </span> - With the rise of live streaming and on-demand viewing, fans can now watch games 
                from anywhere in the world, without needing to be physically present. This has helped grow the global reach of many sports, 
                bringing new fans and revenue streams.
            </li>
            <li> <span class="subtopics"> Social media </span> - Fans can now interact with their favorite athletes and teams in real-time, with 
                social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram. This has helped build stronger connections between fans and their idols, 
                and has given athletes more control over their personal brand.
            </li>
            <li> <span class="subtopics"> Disconnection </span> - However, some argue that technology has also taken away from the communal 
                experience of sports. With the rise of at-home viewing, some worry that fewer people are attending live events, leading to a 
                disconnect between fans and the physical experience of the game.
            </li>
        </ul>    
    
        <p class="topics"> Conclusion </p>
        <p> Overall, the impact of technology on sports has been both positive and negative. While technology has led to significant improvements 
            in equipment, gameplay, and the fan experience, it has also raised concerns about over-reliance on machines and a potential disconnect 
            from the physical experience of sports. As technology continues to advance, it's important to consider both the benefits and the 
            drawbacks and strive for a balance that enhances the sport without losing its essence.
